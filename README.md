# simple-ga-matlab

A 50-line MATLAB implementation of a simple genetic algorithm (GA) with real-value chromosome. 

## Features

* This is a small but working GA code, which is particularly useful to beginners. 
  Actually, I have used it to optimize a functional (a function of a function) 
  in one of my published journal articles. 
  
## File organizations

* There is one script:
  * test_ga.m

* This script will call the "my_ga" function in
  * my_ga.m
  
* The above function will in turn call the "my_fitness" function in
  * my_fitness.m
  
## Example

* The cost (fitness) function (to be minimized) defined in the "my_fitness" function is 
  ```math
      y = (x_1 - 1)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2 + ...
  ```
  We know that the correct solution is 
  ```math 
      x_i = i (i = 1, 2, ...).
  ```
  
* Running the "test_ga.m" script in Matlab, two figures will show up after a few seconds:
  * The first figure shows the evolution of the cost function with respect to the generation.
  * The second figure shows the evolution of the elite (best solution) with respect to the generation.
    As expected, the best solution converges to the correct solution.
